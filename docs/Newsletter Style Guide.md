# <a id="_bnyn6mo6ngmd"></a>__⭐ STYLE GUIDE FOR STEPHANIE’S WEEKLY AI NEWS CONTENT__

*\(For Claude — tone, voice, style, formatting\)*

This guide explains how to write headlines, summaries, and “why it matters” sections in the exact style, tone, and rhythm Stephanie uses in her weekly AI news decks\.

Use this as your reference when generating __Top 5 stories__, __Secondary stories__, and __Launches__\.

# <a id="_mlx21sas58m5"></a>__1\. ✨ Top Stories Style Guide \(Headline \+ Summary \+ Why It Matters\)__

The Top 5 stories are the centerpiece of the weekly report\. They combine newswriting clarity with editorial voice, emotional intelligence, and clean formatting\.

## <a id="_wchlhag879se"></a>__🎯 Overall Tone__

- Smart, concise, news\-forward
- Slightly conversational
- Lightly opinionated in a subtle, thoughtful way
- Never breathless or hyped
- Equal parts analytical and curious
- Confident but not dramatic
- Skimmable but substantive  


## <a id="_v3miwb5ntjs3"></a>__📰 Headline Style__

Your headlines follow a recognizable pattern:

- Short, crisp, high\-impact
- Often ~8–14 words
- Focused on *what happened*, not fluffy framing
- Use active voice:
	- “Meta poaches Ke Yang”
	- “OpenAI completes for\-profit recapitalization”
	- “Extropic AI’s chip to outperform GPUs by 10,000X”
- You do __not__ sensationalize — you distill
- You do __not__ use emojis in Top 5 headlines
- You do __not__ use questions or clever phrases in the headline  


### <a id="_f4thabxyey6f"></a>__Bold usage in headlines__

- Bold only the __most important__ one or two words/phrases
- Common bold types:
	- Key actors: “Meta”, “Uber drivers”
	- Key actions: “cutting 600”, “poaches Ke Yang”
	- Key concept phrases: “domain\-specific models”, “cancer detection”
- Bold is used as a visual anchor for skim readers  


## <a id="_i2wcb2wfytde"></a>__📄 Summary Style__

Your summaries have a __signature cadence__:

- 1–3 sentences, __4–6 lines__ when rendered
- Clear, factual, but with subtle narrative texture
- You zoom out slightly — not just facts, but their meaning
- You include key mechanics of the story
- You often mention:

	- What the company did
	- Why it matters strategically
	- The broader trend


### <a id="_numbers_and_specifics"></a>__Numbers and Specifics:__

__Use restraint with numbers and metrics__\. Include specific numbers only when they're critical to understanding the story:

✅ __Include specifics when critical:__
- Dollar amounts for major deals or valuations \("$10B valuation", "multibillion\-dollar deal"\)
- Timeframes when they matter \("mid November", "2026", "within a decade"\)
- Scale that defines the story \("2M\+ robots", "30 organizations"\)

❌ __Avoid excessive specifics:__
- Exact benchmark scores \(use "outperformed on benchmarks" not "95% vs 71% on AIME 2025"\)
- Precise percentages unless critical \(use "significantly higher" not "15\.3% higher"\)
- Technical benchmark names \(use "coding benchmarks" not "GPQA Diamond"\)
- Exact Elo scores, model version numbers, or other technical metrics
- Multiple competing numbers in one sentence

__Default to the general over the specific__ — readers want the story, not the spreadsheet\.

### <a id="_o5i5o75j2odc"></a>__Examples of the tone in your summaries:__

- "Uber is making a play for AI training data, and using its drivers to power the initiative…"
- "AI browser wars are heating up…"
- "The team released a new AI model that can analyze single\-cell biological data…"


You avoid:

- Hype words like "revolutionary", "game\-changing"
- Overly technical language
- Corporate PR tone
- Excessive numbers and metrics that distract from the narrative


### <a id="_epnju48259y4"></a>__Bold usage in summaries__

- You bold __pivotal, high\-signal phrases  
__
	- “age verification”
	- “corporate restructuring”
	- “future potential”
	- “recognize ‘cold’ tumors”  

- You choose phrases that:  

	- Summarize the stakes
	- Signal what the story is about
	- Help readers skim  


Never bold:

- Whole sentences
- Generic modifiers
- Random adjectives  


## <a id="_uzufpv84waco"></a>__💡 Why It Matters Style__

Your “why it matters” lines are *the most recognizable part of your voice\.*

They follow these patterns:

### <a id="_hz7au4sxlzhh"></a>__1\. A thoughtful question__

- “But what does it mean for real\-world relationships if AI ones always provide immediate validation and need fulfillment?”
- “Are Uber drivers providing human data labeling for algorithms for autonomous vehicles… which will ultimately replace drivers?”  


### <a id="_494d61ryglq1"></a>__2\. A sharp observation__

- “Apple has historically been self\-reliant, but is losing the AI arms race, forcing them to turn to outside support\.”  


### <a id="_ebdxovjhzg71"></a>__3\. A subtle, conceptual implication__

- “Like Cursor for coding, niche applications of AI targeting large user bases are attracting investor attention\.”  


### <a id="_u4uyae2j9u3a"></a>__Tone characteristics:__

- Reflective
- Insightful
- Slightly provocative
- Often contrasts tension or irony
- Never overconfident or absolute
- No bolding
- 1–2 sentences, max 3

## <a id="_qivx0jkrztna"></a>__Examples of Top Story Section__

The below is an example of a top story section:

- Headline: OpenAI completes __for\-profit__ recapitalization
- Summary: OpenAI completed a __corporate restructuring__ that moves its main operations under a for\-profit arm while the nonprofit retains a 26% stake\. The shift gives it flexibility to raise capital and positions the company for a potential __$1 trillion IPO__ in late 2026 or early 2027\.
- Why it matters: As part of the deal, Microsoft now owns 27% of the for\-profit entity, cementing their partnership with OpenAI\.

Here are a few more top stories I have produced, in XML format so that it is easy to follow exactly what went where and what was bolded\. The XML format does not need to be created elsewhere, this is simply for clarity of instructions\. The full set of examples can be found in the Newsletter Stories Example document\.
